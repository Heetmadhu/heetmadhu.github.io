It also includes language, budget, genres, popularity, revenue etc.\nFeatures\n Provide movie suggestions according user’s input. Provide movie suggestions by their past history.  Similar Applications:\n Amazon Prime Netflix Movix Youtube  Objective: People often spend time wasting in the search of movies that they want to watch due to availability of too much options. Movie Recommendation System will help users to find movies accordingly user’s search keywords and similar movies which they liked before. This application will save user’s time and efforts in searching process.\nInitial Sketch\n\r\rLogin Page Design\r\r \rSearch Page Design\r\r \rSearch Result Page Design\r\r\nDesign Sketch\n\r\rSearch Page Design\r\r \rSearch Results\r\r \rClassification\r\r \rClassification Results\r\r \rRecommendation\r\r \rRecommendation Results\r\r\nReport Text Extraction\nObjective of this project is to use text data of movies to calculate inverted term frequency and use that to find similarity between user’s search query and movies. In the TMDB Movies dataset, there are many text fields such as movie title, tagline, overview, keywords, genres, production companies, cast, crew, languages, etc. Title, tagline, overview are in string format and can be used directly, but fields like keywords, genres, production companies are in list of dict format so first I have converted string to literal structure then I have extracted only necessary fields such as name. Other source of information are casts and characters of movies, I can use information about actors and role they played. Similarly from crew information I have only extracted name of director, producer, writer which is good source of information. In the end I have constructed document for each movies that contains all the text data mentioned above. For better results I have applied snowball stemmer\nSearch Result\nTo find similarity between search query and movies first I have generated word vector for each movie and using word vectors inverted term frequency was calculated. Now for new query we need to generate word vector of query and then calculate inverted term frequency. After that we need to calculate cosine similarity between inverted term frequency of query and of each movie. Then we will find top results whose cosine similarity is maximum.\nReferences\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/kernels\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html\n","date":1461733200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461733200,"objectID":"8680b57cbc973c2873a39cc293605ff7","permalink":"https://heetmadhu.github.io/project/movie-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/movie-project/","section":"project","summary":"Movie recommender that will help and will save time of users by suggesting movies that they might like according to their search criteria and past ratings.","tags":null,"title":"Movie Search","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461733200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461733200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://heetmadhu.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An android app which sends SMS containing the URL of location with predefined message when any one go to our app and tap the emergency button to the relatives which they have selected previously. .","tags":["Demo"],"title":"Stay Alive","type":"project"}]
